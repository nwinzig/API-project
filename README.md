# About BnB: #

BnB is a clone of AirBnB. It is a web application for users to find a location to book for a stay, or to become a host for such users. This clone currently showcases some of the features of the original site. It has the capability to create secure users, allow these users to find and leave reviews on locations, along with allow users to publish their own spots.
